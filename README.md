# TomoPy_GUI
Written by B.M.Gibson and Matt Newville.  
A simple user interface for TomoPy.  
TomoPy can be found at https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy.  
Currently, GUI is optimized for APS 13BM datasets. Future iterations will expand to other data formats.

Known issues include: 
- Entropy centering method performs poorly for most datasets. Best to use default Vghia Vo centering method. Future updates to Entropy will come from either this UI or TomoPy.
- Some features slow (movie, data conversion, TomoPy algorithms other than gridrec).
- Default ring removal values are probably not good for most reconstructions. A branch has been opened for developing this feature further.
